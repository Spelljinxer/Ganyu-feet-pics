                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <p>A half-human, half-adeptus hybrid. She is a young woman with pale blue hair, fading into a darker shade at the end.
                        Her hair is styled in a layered, chin-length cut with two shoulder-length locks in front and the back section left long.
                        <br><br>
                        Though she mostly resembles a human, she has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. Many people confuse it as a headdress, a misconception that Ganyu actively encourages. 
                        She has purple multicolored heterochromatic eyes that fade into pink then gold.
                        <br><br>
                        Her outfit consists of a black bodysuit with gold accents on the legs underneath a white and purple bodice with long ends similar to a tailcoat, with a separated pair of sleeves to match. The bodysuit meets at the back of her neck to make a bow.
                        She has white heels with gold accents and gray bottoms, with red knots around her ankles.

                    <h1>Personality</h1>
                    <p>Ganyu is usually very quiet and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage.
                        She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.
                        <br><br>
                        Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. 
                        The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes
